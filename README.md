# Questions To Ask During An Interview As a Developer

This is the questions I might ask during an interview, depending on the information I already have, the company, and everything else. I won't ask every single question, and you should not either. Life is too short.

This was, at the beginning, an aside to [this article](https://thevaluable.dev/find-best-software-developer-job/), on my blog. It grew as the time went by.

Some questions don't necessarily reveal what I want to hear, and it's on purpose. If you want to know my stand on things, you can still read my [blog](https://thevaluable.dev/). Most of the time, I focus more on the business / people / culture / processes. To me, it's where things can go eerie quickly.
